# Assignment 2
Breadth-first search

# Overview
This module runs breadth first search on a directed graph. The Graph class can be initialized from a path to an adjacency list. The bfs function can be called on a Graph object with a start node as an argument. If no end node is specified, the function returns the breadth-first traversal of the graph beginning at the start node. If an end node is specified, the function returns the shortest path from the start to the end node.

For more info on breadth first search, see [this helpful explanation.](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/breadth-first-search/tutorial/)
